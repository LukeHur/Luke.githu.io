  <h1>Hello, my name is Luke. I am in a school called SCS. I currently am in 9th grade having computer science class for the first time.<h1>
  <p1>When I was in 8th grade, I had a friend named Paul. He would brag about learning computer science class but also would encourage me to do some "computer stuff." The biggest project I ever did is to install Mac OS into my windows computer. Mostly I enjoyed installing games that would only work in Wii, Psp, Ps3 and other gaming systems. For now, in my computer class, I learned few basic Git command, using computer numbers, and other basic stuff. I am new to using Linux Mint, but I'm getting used it.<p1>
  <p>The first thing I learned in my computer class was learning how to take many types of screenshots. After learning these things, I got to know about using our operating system and their keyboard commands. Getting used to this knowledge led me to a further step. We started to use control systems like Git. It took me few weeks to understand what Git is used for. Our class learned little about Vim and Nano but for now, we are learning about Arduino.</p>
