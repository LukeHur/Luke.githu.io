  <h1>Hello, my name is Luke. I am in a school called SCS. I currently is in 9th grade having computer science class for the first time. When I was in 8th grade, I had a friend named Paul. He would brag about learning computer science class but also would encourage me to do some "computer stuffs." The biggest project I ever did is to install Mac OS in to my windows computer. Mostly I enjoyed installing games that would only work in Wii, Psp, Ps3 and other gaming systems. For now, in my computer class, I learned few basic Git command, using computer numbers, and other basic stuffs. I am new to using Linux Mint, but I'm getting used to it.</h1>
